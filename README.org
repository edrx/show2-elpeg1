My [[http://anggtwu.net/emacsconf2023.html][presentation]] at the [[https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/][EmacsConf2023]] was titled "REPLs in strange
places: Lua, LaTeX, LPeg, LPegRex, TikZ". Due to personal problems I
had to present it in a very incomplete form, and it ended up being
mainly about the design decisions behind some Lua programs - or
"modules", or "libraries" - that were not finished at the time of the
conference.

All those programs are built on top of two modules: [[http://anggtwu.net/LUA/Show2.lua.html#introduction][Show2.lua]] and
[[http://anggtwu.net/LUA/ELpeg1.lua.html][ELpeg1.lua]]. After the conference I wrote this sandboxed tutorial -
[[http://anggtwu.net/eev-intros/find-show2-intro.html][(find-show2-intro)]] - with [[http://anggtwu.net/eepitch.html][executable]] instructions for installing this
version of the modules and testing most of their main parts.

Note that at some point I will create versions of Show2 and ELpeg1
that will be incompatible with the current ones, and that will have
names like Show3, Show4, ELpeg2, ELpeg3, etc - and the repository with
these other versions will have other names that are not
"show2-elpeg1".
